Description: network backup, recovery and verification - meta-package
 Bacula is a set of programs to manage backup, recovery and verification
 of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds.

 damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is scalable from small
 single computer systems to networks of hundreds of machines.
