Description: network backup, recovery and verification - meta-package
 Bacula is a set of programs to manage backup, recovery and verification
 of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds.
 .
 It is efficient and relatively easy to use, while offering many advanced
 storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost or
 damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is scalable from small
 single computer systems to networks of hundreds of machines.

 This meta-package installs the entire suite of Bacula applications: job
 scheduling, storage control, node connector, and administrative console.
