Description: monitoring and host and network monitoring system - metapackage
 Icinga is a modular monitoring framework for hosts, services, and
 networks, based on the Nagios project. It is designed to be easy to
 understand and modify to fit any need.
 .
 Features include:
  * monitoring of network services via ping, SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, or
    TCP port;
  * plugin interface to allow for user-developed service checks;
  * contact notifications when problems occur and get resolved (via
    email, pager, or user-defined method)
  * support for proactive problem resolution (handlers can be defined to
    be run during service or host events);
  * web output: current status, notifications, problem history, log
    file, etc.
 .
 This is a metapackage which depends on the Icinga core and the web
 front-end.
