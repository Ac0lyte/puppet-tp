Description: network-wide graphing framework (node)
 Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of
 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still
 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.
 .
 This package contains the daemon for the nodes being monitored.  You should
 install it on all the nodes in your network. It will know how to extract all
 sorts of data from the node it runs on, and will wait for the gatherer to
 request this data for further processing.
 .
 It includes a range of plugins capable of extracting common values such as cpu
 usage, network usage, load average, and so on. Creating your own plugins which
 are capable of extracting other system-specific values is very easy, and is
 often done in a matter of minutes. You can also create plugins which relay
 information from other devices in your network that can't run Munin, such as a
 switch or a server running another operating system, by using SNMP or similar
 technology.
 .
 Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent
 RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can follow a link
