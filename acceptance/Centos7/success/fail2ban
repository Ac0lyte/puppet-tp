Summary     : Daemon to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
Description :
Fail2Ban scans log files and bans IP addresses that makes too many password
failures. It updates firewall rules to reject the IP address. These rules can
be defined by the user. Fail2Ban can read multiple log files such as sshd or
Apache web server ones.

Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications attempts
however it cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication presents.
Configure services to use only two factor or public/private authentication
mechanisms if you really want to protect services.

This is a meta-package that will install the default configuration.  Other
sub-packages are available to install support for other actions and
configurations.
