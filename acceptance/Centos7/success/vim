Summary     : The common files needed by any version of the VIM editor
Description :
VIM (VIsual editor iMproved) is an updated and improved version of the
vi editor.  Vi was the first real screen-based editor for UNIX, and is
still very popular.  VIM improves on vi by adding new features:
multiple windows, multi-level undo, block highlighting and more.  The
vim-common package contains files which every VIM binary will need in
order to run.

If you are installing vim-enhanced or vim-X11, you'll also need
to install the vim-common package.
