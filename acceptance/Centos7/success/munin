Summary     : Network-wide graphing framework (node)
Description :
Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs
of virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still
maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.

This package contains node software. You should install it on all the nodes
in your network. It will know how to extract all sorts of data from the
node it runs on, and will wait for the gatherer to request this data for
further processing.

It includes a range of plugins capable of extracting common values such as
cpu usage, network usage, load average, and so on. Creating your own plugins
which are capable of extracting other system-specific values is very easy,
and is often done in a matter of minutes. You can also create plugins which
relay information from other devices in your network that can't run Munin,
such as a switch or a server running another operating system, by using SNMP
or similar technology.

Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent
RRDtool.
