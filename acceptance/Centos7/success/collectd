Summary     : Statistics collection daemon for filling RRD files
Description :
collectd is a small daemon written in C for performance.  It reads various
system  statistics  and updates  RRD files,  creating  them if necessary.
Since the daemon doesn't need to startup every time it wants to update the
files it's very fast and easy on the system. Also, the statistics are very
fine grained since the files are updated every 10 seconds.
