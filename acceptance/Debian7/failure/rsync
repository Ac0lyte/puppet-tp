Description: fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
 rsync is a fast and versatile file-copying tool which can copy locally
 and to/from a remote host. It offers many options to control its behavior,
 and its remote-update protocol can minimize network traffic to make
 transferring updates between machines fast and efficient.

 command for everyday use.

 This package provides both the rsync command line tool and optional
 daemon functionality.
