Description: Advanced version control system
 Subversion, also known as svn, is a version control system much like
 the Concurrent Versions System (CVS).  Version control systems allow
 many individuals (who may be distributed geographically) to
 collaborate on a set of files (typically source code).  Subversion has
 all the major features of CVS, plus certain new features that CVS
 users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn), tools to create a
 Subversion repository (svnadmin) and to make a repository available
 over a network (svnserve).
