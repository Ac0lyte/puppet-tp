Description: Vi IMproved - Common files
 Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.

 Many new features have been added: multi level undo, syntax
 highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename
 completion, block operations, folding, Unicode support, etc.
 .
 This package contains files shared by all non GUI-enabled vim
 variants (vim and vim-tiny currently) available in Debian.
 Examples of such shared files are: manpages, common executables
 like xxd, and configuration files.
